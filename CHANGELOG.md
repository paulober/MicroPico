# Change Log

All notable changes to the "MicroPico" extension will be documented in this file.

>_Based on structure recommendations from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)._

## Known issues
- vREPL tab-completion on Windows isn't inline. (that's also cool but different to macOS or Linux behaviour)
- Run current file does not include modules that are localy imported and in current workspace, unless you upload the python file containing the module via the upload file or project feature first. (since ever)

## [3.0.0] - 2023-04-10

# Added
- Remote filesystem/workspace integration of the Pico (W) filesystem.

- `picowgo.gcBeforeUpload` runs garbage collector before uploading files to free some memory for more stable uploads

# Changed
- `picowgo.syncFileTypes` settings datatype changed to `array`

- NEW REQUIREMENT: [`pyserial`Python Pip package](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
- Terminal behaviour is now a virtual REPL which can execute commands on the remote Pico (W) MicroPython REPL
- To enable the new remote workspace feature, a new queuing system between the serial port and the VSCode inputs had to be developed
to cope with the bottleneck of a *serial* connection. For stability reasons, I therefore do **not** recommend excessive multitasking with the features of the extension in conjunction with the Pico. It should work fine and also handle a large load, but you don't need to overuse it.

# Removed 
- `ctrlCOnConnect` setting, because its now the default
- FTP-Server, it was deprecated had security vulnarabilities and some users reported problems using it
- Cut many other dependencies
